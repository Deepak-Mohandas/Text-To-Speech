# Text-To-Speech

Text to speech is the generation of speech synthesized from the text.

There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in Python. One of such APIs is the Google Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API.

The technology is used to communicate with users when reading a screen is not possible or impractical. This not only opens up apps and information to use in new ways but can also make the world more accessible to people who cannot read text on a screen.


The technology behind the TTS has evolved over the past few decades. Using natural language processing, it is now possible to produce very natural speech that includes changes in pitch, speed, pronunciation and inflexion.Â 

On this project I will take you through building your TTS with Python.


## Installation - Prerequisites


```bash
  pip install nltk

```
```bash
  pip install newspaper
```
```bash
  pip install gTTS
```

These are the followings steps to build the Image Converter GUI with Python.
